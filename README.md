EECS 731 Homework 6

Project 6 - D(St)reams of Anomalies

1.  Set up a data science project structure in a new git repository in your GitHub account
2.  Download the benchmark data set from Kaggle. Please see references for url.
3.  Load the  one  of the data set into panda data frames
4.  Formulate one or two ideas on how feature engineering would help the data set to establish additional value using exploratory data analysis
5.  Build one or more anomaly detection models to determine the  anomalies  using the other columns as features
6.  Document your process and results
7.  Commit your notebook, source code, visualizations and other supporting files to the git repository in GitHub

Important Steps:
1. Data acquisition
2. Feature engineering
3. Data exploration
4. Model implementation
5. Conclusion
